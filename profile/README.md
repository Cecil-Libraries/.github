# Cecil Libraries Organization
Welcome to the Cecil Libraries Organization's Home Page.

## Who Are We?
We are a group stemmed out of the USA founded by Chaosyr. We are focused on creating nice and easy to use software for mods, applications and any other form of software.

Our rough moto; "Provide as much as we can, while keeping things simple"

What that means is we aim to provide easy to use software while providing as much as we can, an example of this can be seen with Cecil.ANSI_Utils and Cecil.Bridge, with a simple Object Creation and a few relevant functions that developers need to use.
